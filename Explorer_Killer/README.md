# Explorer Killer Script

## SYNOPSIS

This script runs a continuous PowerShell command that forcefully stops the `explorer.exe` process on Windows machines. As a result, the desktop environment including taskbar and file explorer will be hidden until the system is restarted.

## USAGE

- Execute the script (e.g., via BadUSB or DuckyScript) on a Windows 10 or 11 system.
- The script silently runs in the background without user notification.
- To restore the desktop, a reboot of the machine is required.

## TARGET

Windows 10 and Windows 11 operating systems.
