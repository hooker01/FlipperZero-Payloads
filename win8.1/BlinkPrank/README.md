# BlinkPrank

## Overview

This payload runs a PowerShell script on a Windows machine that creates a fullscreen flashing window with a custom message. It attempts to block keyboard and mouse input, making it difficult to close without restarting the system.

## Usage

- Replace `'WRITE_YOUR_TEXT'` in the DuckyScript `.txt` payload with your desired message.
- Run the payload on a Windows 8.1.
- The script will display a blinking black-and-white fullscreen window showing the message and block input devices.

## Target

Windows 8.1,...

## Notes

- Blocks keyboard input and disables closing the window using Alt+F4 or other shortcuts.
- Runs across all connected monitors.
- Requires PowerShell with Windows Forms support.
- Intended for prank and educational purposes only.
