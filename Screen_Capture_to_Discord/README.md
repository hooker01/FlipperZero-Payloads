# Screen Capture to Discord Webhook

This Flipper Zero payload runs a PowerShell script that periodically takes fullscreen screenshots on a Windows machine and uploads them to a Discord webhook.

## Usage

- Replace the placeholder `WEBHOOK_LINK` in the script with your actual Discord webhook URL.
- Run the payload on the target Windows machine.
- The script will silently capture and upload screenshots every 15 seconds.

## Notes

- Works on Windows 10 and 11.
- May not function correctly on all systems due to differences in permissions, antivirus settings, or Windows configurations.
- Intended for educational purposes only.
